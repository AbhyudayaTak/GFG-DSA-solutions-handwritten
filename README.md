# GFG-DSA-solutions-handwritten

Hey DSA Aspirant!👋,
Welcome to my personal repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems,
Each problem includes:

- 🧠 **My Thought Process**: My step-by-step approach to breaking down the problem.
- 📝 **Dry Run**: creating logic through sample examples and operating them in my code.
- 💻 **Code Snippet**: My GFG code snippet.
- 🖋️ **Handwritten Notes**: My personal handwritten notes for deeply understanding every single problem.

**Handwritten logic. Dry runs. code snippets. This isn’t just DSA — it’s deep understanding.**
**HAPPY CODING❤️**
